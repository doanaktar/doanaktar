## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer focused on backend development, and exploring the intersection of AI and software infrastructure.  
My day job involves building robust backend systems using Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, with a strong emphasis on performance, scalability, and clean API design.  
I have hands-on experience with AI-powered systems, including vector databases (PgVector, ChromaDB), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and prompt-based automation.  
I'm particularly interested in how large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models are reshaping the future of backend engineering.
